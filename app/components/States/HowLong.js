            Use of the OnlineDivorce.com service usually takes between 30
            minutes and two hours or more, depending on the complexity of the
            case. Clients start by filling out a questionnaire and can either
            complete it in one sitting or save their progress and complete it at
            a later date.

            Once the documents have been completed, they need to be filed with
            the other spouseâ€™s signature. More information regarding the
            finalization of the divorce case is provided once the paperwork has
            been completed and submitted to the court.
