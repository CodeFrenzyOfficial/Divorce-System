          Rules for child support in Alabama

        <div className=" text-[#666666] text-base space-y-4">
          <p>
            Alabama has adopted specific state-mandated child support guidelines
            which apply in almost every case, barring extraordinary
            circumstances. Both parties’ gross incomes and certain child-related
            expenses are considered when calculating the child support
            obligation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, child support payments continue until the child
            reaches eighteen years of age and can be extended until they
            complete their secondary education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Child support guidelines in Alabama are adopted from the official
            Child Support Guidelines in the Alabama Rules of Judicial
            Administration: Rule 32. These guidelines will be presumed to be
            correct unless the amount is shown to somehow be unjust or
            inappropriate under the circumstances of a case. A written agreement
            between the parents for a different amount will also be allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A standardized Child Support Guidelines form and Child Support
            Income Statement/Affidavit must be filed in every case in which
            child support is requested. There is also a procedure for expedited
            processing in child support cases. Alabama driver’s licenses may be
            suspended for failure to pay child support [Code of Alabama: Title
            30, Chapters 3-5 to 3-6.1, 3-60 to 3-71, 3-110 to 3-115, 3-170 to
            3-179, 3-190 to 3-200 and Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration:
            Rules 32 and 35].
